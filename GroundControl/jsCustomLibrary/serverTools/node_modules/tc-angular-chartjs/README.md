> AngularJS directives for [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/carlcraig/tc-angular-chartjs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/carlcraig/tc-angular-chartjs)

## Installation

Ensure you have [installed Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#getting-started-installation)

#### npm

```bash
npm install tc-angular-chartjs --save
```

#### bower

Bower support has been dropped but you can still use tc-angular-chartjs with Bower using [bower-npm-resolver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower-npm-resolver).

#### download

You can download the source archive from the github [releases](https://github.com/carlcraig/tc-angular-chartjs/releases) page.

Just include `dist/tc-angular-chartjs.js` into your project.

## Basic Usage

Add `tc.chartjs` to your modules dependencies e.g.

```javascript
angular.module( 'app', ['tc.chartjs']);
```

You will then have access to the following directives:
- tc-chartjs
- tc-chartjs-line
- tc-chartjs-bar
- tc-chartjs-horizontalbar
- tc-chartjs-radar
- tc-chartjs-polararea
- tc-chartjs-pie
- tc-chartjs-doughnut
- tc-chartjs-bubble

Just place one of these directives on a `canvas` element to create a Chart.js chart.

You will also want to give the chart some `data`, `options` and `plugins`. These can be provided via the `chart-options`, `chart-data` and `chart-plugins` attributes.

For data structures, options and inline plugins please refer to [Chart.js documentation](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/)

You can also handle chart clicks via the `chart-click` attribute.

Example Pie Chart

```html
<canvas
  tc-chartjs-pie
  chart-data="myData"
  chart-options="myOptions"
  chart-plugins="myPlugins"
  chart-click="onChartClick(event)"
></canvas>
```
```javascript
$scope.myData = {
  // Chart.js data structure goes here
  // e.g. Pie Chart Data Structure http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#doughnut-pie-chart-data-structure
  labels: [
    "Red",
    "Blue",
    "Yellow"
  ],
  datasets: [
    {
      data: [300, 50, 100],
      backgroundColor: [
        "#FF6384",
        "#36A2EB",
        "#FFCE56"
      ],
      hoverBackgroundColor: [
        "#FF6384",
        "#36A2EB",
        "#FFCE56"
      ]
    }
  ]
};

$scope.myOptions =  {
  // Chart.js options go here
  // e.g. Pie Chart Options http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#doughnut-pie-chart-chart-options
};

$scope.myPlugins = [{
  // Chart.js inline plugins go here
  // e.g. http://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/developers/plugins.html#using-plugins
}];

$scope.onChartClick = function (event) {
  console.log(event);
};

```

For more examples please view the `demo` folder.

## Using the `tc-chartjs` directive

When using the `tc-chartjs` directive you will need to add an additional attribute to
say which type of chart should be created.

Just attach a `chart-type=""` attribute to the canvas element.

```html
<canvas
  tc-chartjs
  chart-type="doughnut"
  chart-data="myData"
  chart-options="myOptions"
></canvas>
```

Available Types:

- line
- bar
- horizontalbar
- radar
- polararea
- pie
- doughnut
- bubble

Passing another value to chart-type than the above will try to create a chart of
that type, which is useful if you have extended Chart.js with custom chart types,
e.g. through plugins.
